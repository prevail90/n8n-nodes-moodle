## Acknowledgments

This project was developed collaboratively with assistance from Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) for:
- API integration architecture and HTTP request formatting
- Comprehensive workflow design and use case implementation
- Docker networking solutions and debugging approaches
- Moodle API parameter formatting and error handling

The development involved extensive problem-solving, testing, and iterative improvements 
to create a production-ready Moodle integration for n8n.
